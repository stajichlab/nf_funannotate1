# SOURCED (not executed) by the GENOME_CLEAN process before AAFTF fcs_gx_purge,

# Configure the source location of the GX database via FCS_GX_DB_SRC (a directory
# containing all.gxi / all.gxs etc). The default below is the UCR HPCC shared
# NCBI FCS-GX install at its REAL path under /bigdata — NOT the /srv/... path:
# /srv/projects is a symlink to /bigdata/operations/pkgadmin/srv/projects and is
# only visible on the login/compute node host, not inside the AAFTF container
# (which only binds /bigdata). 0.5.4 is itself a host-only symlink to 0.5.0.
# Set FCS_GX_DB_SRC before launching the pipeline / in the profile env to
# override for your site.
#
# This script is idempotent: if /dev/shm/gxdb/all.gxi already exists it does
# nothing, so concurrent GENOME_CLEAN tasks on the same node share one copy.
