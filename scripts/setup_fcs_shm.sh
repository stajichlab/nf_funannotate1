# SOURCED (not executed) by the GENOME_CLEAN process before AAFTF fcs_gx_purge,

# Keeping the DB in /dev/shm (RAM) is required for acceptable FCS-GX performance.

# Configure the source location of the GX database via FCS_GX_DB_SRC (a directory
# containing all.gxi / all.gxs etc). The default below is set to the UCR HPCC
# shared NCBI FCS-GX install (on /srv, which sits on the shared /bigdata GPFS —
# node-visible). Set it to your site's FCS-GX database path (or export
# FCS_GX_DB_SRC before launching the pipeline / in the profile env).
#
# This script is idempotent: if /dev/shm/gxdb/all.gxi already exists it does
# nothing, so concurrent GENOME_CLEAN tasks on the same node share one copy.
